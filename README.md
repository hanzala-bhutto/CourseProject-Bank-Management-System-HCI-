## Introduction

The **Bank Management System** is a simulation project developed to demonstrate the principles of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**. The system focuses on user-friendly UX/UI design and offers functionality for managing a bank's operations, built using C#, SQL Express, and the Bunifu Framework.

## Tech Stack

- **C#**: Core programming language for application logic.
- **Microsoft SQL Express**: Database management system.
- **Bunifu Framework**: For modern UI design and customization.
- **Visual Studio**: Development environment.
- **HCI Principles**: Focused on user-centric design.

## Features

- Manage customer accounts and transactions.
- Intuitive, modern UI with the Bunifu framework.
- Secure database management with SQL Express.
- Demonstrates key HCI principles for effective interaction design.
